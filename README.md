# SportsCarPricePrediction
Developed a regression-based machine learning model to accurately predict sports car prices.
## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the prices of sports cars using machine learning regression techniques. The model leverages features such as brand, engine capacity, horsepower, mileage, and other relevant attributes. By learning from historical car price data, it provides reliable price estimations for future listings.

## Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleans, normalizes, and prepares raw datasets for model training.

Feature Engineering: Extracts and transforms key attributes to enhance predictive performance.

Model Training: Implements multiple regression techniques to build an accurate prediction model.

Model Evaluation: Assesses performance using metrics such as RÂ² score, MAE, and RMSE.

Visualization: Provides data insights through plots and graphs to highlight relationships between variables.
## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed and the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/SportsCarPricePrediction.git
cd SportsCarPricePrediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
